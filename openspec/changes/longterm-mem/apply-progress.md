## Slice 1 — longterm-mem-scaffold-module (R-001, R-021, R-002, R-020) (COMPLETE)

All Slice 1 tasks (Bootstrap 1.0.1–1.0.4, R-001 1.1–1.3, R-021 1.4–1.5, R-002
1.6–1.8, R-020 1.9–1.10, verification 1.11) implemented and ticked in
`tasks.md`.

### Bootstrap

- [x] 1.0.1 `longterm-mem/go.mod` (`module github.com/labdrian-ai/labdrian-sdd-overlay/longterm-mem`, `go 1.26.1`) + `go get` for `modernc.org/sqlite@v1.57.0`, `github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk@v1.7.0`, `github.com/pelletier/go-toml/v2@v2.4.3` (pinned upfront; only `modernc.org/sqlite` is imported by production code so far — the other two are locked in `go.mod`/`go.sum` for later slices).
- [x] 1.0.2 `.github/workflows/ci.yml` job `test-longterm-mem` (checkout, `setup-go@v5` on `longterm-mem/go.mod`, gofmt, vet, staticcheck, `go test ./... -cover`), cloned from `test-tui`.
- [x] 1.0.3 `openspec/config.yaml`: new `longterm-mem` entry under `testing.layers`; `apply.tdd.test_command`/`verify.test_command`/`verify.build_command` now run `cd longterm-mem && go test ./...` first (with an explicit `cd ..` back to repo root before the existing engine/tui/tools chain — verified to execute correctly end-to-end).
- [x] 1.0.4 `longterm-mem/README.md` refreshed: per-project component description, module-boundary note (own `go.mod`, third-party deps allowed, outside `engine/`'s zero-dep boundary), fixed binary install path; full CLI/MCP surface documentation deferred to 10b.8 per CHK-05.

### R-001 — Standalone Module Outside engine/

- [x] 1.1–1.2 `longterm-mem/cmd/longterm-mem/main.go` + `main_test.go::TestMain_BuildsIndependentModule` — RED confirmed (`no packages to build`) before `main.go` existed; GREEN after a minimal subcommand dispatcher (usage text, exit 2 on unknown subcommand). The build test writes its output to `t.TempDir()` via `-o` so it never leaves a compiled binary inside the module's own source tree.
- [x] 1.3 Re-ran `engine/skills/zero_fetch_test.go::TestZeroFetchImportAllowlist` unmodified — still passes; `engine/go.mod` still carries zero third-party requirements (`go 1.21`, no `require` block) despite `longterm-mem/go.mod` adding sqlite/mcp-sdk/go-toml.

### R-021 — No CLI Shelling to Engram (guard)

- [x] 1.4–1.5 `longterm-mem/exec_allowlist_test.go::TestOSExecImportAllowlist` — statically walks every non-test `.go` file under `longterm-mem/` (skipping `testdata/`) and fails if any file other than `internal/vault/runner.go` imports `os/exec`. Passes vacuously today (only `main.go` exists, no `os/exec` import). Triangulated by temporarily adding a throwaway file that imports `os/exec` outside the allowed path — confirmed the guard fails with a named violation — then removed it and reconfirmed green.

### R-002 — Read-Only Engram Connection

- [x] 1.6–1.8 `longterm-mem/internal/engram/store.go` — `Open(dbPath string) (*Store, error)` opens `modernc.org/sqlite` with DSN `file:<path>?mode=ro&_txlock=deferred&_pragma=query_only(1)&_pragma=busy_timeout(2000)` (D1; verified against the modernc.org/sqlite v1.57.0 driver source — `mode=ro` is SQLite's own URI open-mode parameter, `_pragma`/`_txlock` are the Go driver's DSN shorthand keys). Default path resolves to `$HOME/.engram/engram.db` when `dbPath` is empty. `TestOpen_DefaultIsReadOnly` and `TestOpen_OverridePathStaysReadOnly` both build their fixture under `t.TempDir()` (the default-path case overrides `$HOME` via `t.Setenv`, never touching the real `~/.engram/engram.db`) and assert both a successful read and a failing `INSERT`/`UPDATE`. REFACTOR extracted `readOnlyDSN(path string) string`.
- [x] `internal/engram/testdata/schema.sql` — the live `observations` table DDL (dumped read-only from `~/.engram/engram.db`, matching Engram design-notes #3133/#3129) minus the unused `sessions` foreign key.

### R-020 — Mid-Term Query Scoping

- [x] 1.9–1.10 `longterm-mem/internal/engram/store.go` — `ListObservations(project string) ([]Observation, error)` (`WHERE project = ? AND deleted_at IS NULL`). `TestListObservations_ScopesProjectAndExcludesSoftDeleted` fixtures three rows (active/P, soft-deleted/P, active/other-project) and asserts exactly the active/P row comes back.

### Verification

- [x] 1.11 `cd longterm-mem && go test ./...` — all packages pass. `bash -n bin/labdrian-overlay` — clean.

`cd longterm-mem && gofmt -l .` — clean. `go vet ./...` — clean. `go test ./... -cover` — `internal/engram` 75.9%, `cmd/longterm-mem` 0.0% (scaffold dispatcher, no subcommands yet), root `guard` package has no statements to cover.
`cd engine && go test ./...` — all packages pass (zero-dep gate intact, `engine/go.mod` unchanged).

### Authored line budget

Authored changed lines (git diff --numstat additions+deletions for tracked
files, plain line counts for untracked files), **excluding `go.sum`**:

| File | Lines |
|---|---|
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (diff) | 29 |
| `longterm-mem/README.md` (diff) | 23 |
| `openspec/config.yaml` (diff) | 10 |
| `openspec/changes/longterm-mem/tasks.md` (diff, checkbox toggles) | 30 |
| `longterm-mem/go.mod` (new) | 19 |
| `longterm-mem/exec_allowlist_test.go` (new) | 67 |
| `longterm-mem/cmd/longterm-mem/main.go` (new) | 33 |
| `longterm-mem/cmd/longterm-mem/main_test.go` (new) | 26 |
| `longterm-mem/internal/engram/store.go` (new) | 101 |
| `longterm-mem/internal/engram/store_test.go` (new) | 141 |
| `longterm-mem/internal/engram/testdata/schema.sql` (new) | 42 |
| **Total (go.sum excluded only)** | **521** |
| Total excluding `go.mod` too (cached session-preflight convention) | 502 |
| Go+SQL implementation/test code only (excl. tasks.md/README/CI/config/go.mod) | 410 |

This is over the 400-line budget under every counting convention tried
(exceeds by 10–121 lines depending on what is excluded). The design's own
forecast for this slice was 330–370 authored lines and did not name a split
point for Slice 1 (design-notes #3133 Slice Map: only slices 2, 3, 8, 10, 11,
12 have named split points). No scope was added beyond the unchecked Slice 1
tasks; the overage comes from: (a) `store_test.go`'s three scenarios needing
two shared fixture helpers plus real read/write assertions per strict-TDD's
no-trivial-assertion rules, (b) the live-schema fixture (`schema.sql`, 42
lines) matching the design's own instruction to mirror #3129 verbatim, and
(c) tasks.md checkbox-toggle diff noise (30 lines for 15 ticked items — 1
add+1 del per line). Flagged as a risk for the orchestrator; no further split
was invented since none was authorized for this slice.
